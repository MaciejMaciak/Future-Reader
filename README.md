### Python interpretation.

def futurereader(a,b):
    b += -a
    a += b
    b = -b + a
    return a


### What if these variables were about logical sentences and not arithmetic sentences. Could this code somehow determine that someone is lying or can be lied if a was the person speaking and b was the person listening?
