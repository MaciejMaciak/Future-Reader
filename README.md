### Python interpretation.

def futurereader(a,b):
    b += -a
    a += b
    b = -b + a
    return a, b


### What if these variables were about logical sentences and not arithmetic sentences. Could this code somehow determine that someone is lying or can be lied if a was the person speaking and b was the person listening?

### Future Reader is a piece of logic written in Python. It is an approach from a logical and philosophical point of view to the theory of lying. Well, it answers the question of when a person speaking a sentence may lie or conceal the truth. It serves to some extent to reflexively approach a person during a discussion or speech.
