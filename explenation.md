The code is intended to have logical applications. 
It works on arithmetic numbers, but works best on simple logic sentences. 
The assumption or the result itself is not the issue. 
The important thing is how to transition between two sentences. 
The interlocutor i.e. person “b” has the opportunity to add a sentence if person “a” does not speak the “truth” recognized by interlocutor “b”. 
The reaction occurs faster than the negation of the answer by person “a” and the acceptance of the answer by person “b”.
